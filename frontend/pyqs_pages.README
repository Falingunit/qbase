PYQs pages and modules

Pages
- pyqs.html → Exams (click an exam to open chapters)
- pyqs_chapters.html → Subjects as tabs + chapter list for selected subject
- pyqs_questions.html → Question list + viewer for a given exam+subject+chapter

Modules
- pyqs-common.js: Shared utilities (fetchers, toolbar, stars, helpers)
- pyqs-index.js: Logic for pyqs.html (exams only)
- pyqs-chapters.js: Logic for pyqs_chapters.html (subjects as tabs)
- pyqs-questions.js: Logic for pyqs_questions.html
  (legacy; current flow opens the PYQs Assignment viewer instead)

Deep links (URL params)
- Chapters (optional subject): pyqs_chapters.html?exam=<id>[&subject=<id>]
- Questions: pyqs_questions.html?exam=<id>&subject=<id>&chapter=<id>
  (param `view` is optional and inferred)

Assignment-style PYQs viewer
- pyqs_assignment.html opens the full assignment UI for a chapter’s PYQs.
- pyqs-assignment-bridge.js configures assignment.js with a custom loader
  and deterministic assignment id/title derived from exam/subject/chapter.

Notes
- The previous monolithic pyqs.js is no longer referenced by these pages and
  can be removed once you’re happy with the split.
